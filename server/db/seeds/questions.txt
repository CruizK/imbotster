*How are you?
Somewhere between better and best.
All the better now that you asked.
Much better now that you are with me.
At minding my own business? Better than most people.
I am as happy as a tick on a big, fat dog.
Do you really care?
Armed and ready!
My lawyer says I don’t have to answer that question.
I’ve been going through some crests and troughs in my life. Is everything stable at your end?
Like you, but better.
I could really go for a massage.
I was fine until you asked.
If I were doing any better, I'd hire you to enjoy it with me.
I hear good things, but you should never listen to rumors.
Overworked and underpaid.
I don't know, you tell me. How am I right now?
Can't complain. Nobody listens to me anyway.
If I were any better, I'd be you.
Not so well, does that bother you?
I can't complain! It's against the Company Policy.
Average. Not terrific, not terrible, just average.
If I were any better, I'd be illegal.
So far, so good!
Better now that I'm talking to you.
Well, I haven't had my morning coffee yet and no one has gotten hurt, so I'd say "pretty good" at this point in time.
Well, unless the weather has different plans in store.
I have no way of knowing.
Living a dream. Please don't wake me up.
At least there’s plenty of room for improvement!
I'm pretty standard right now.
Doing well, unless you have intentions of shooting me.
Happy and content, thank you.
Compared to who?
Do I have to answer?
Well enough to chat with you if you wish to.
Going great. Hope this status quo persists for rest of the day.
Physically? Mentally? Spiritually? Socioeconomically? Financially? I'm not sure how to answer that!?!
Strange, and getting stranger.
Not so good, but I plan on lying at my press conference.
If I had a tail, I would wag it.
I've heard various opinions: What's yours?
How am I. . . what?
Thank you for asking, though you can judge for yourself.
Why do you ask? Are you a doctor?
I'm better than I was, but not nearly as good as I'm going to be.
I think I'm doing OK. How do you think I'm doing?
I can’t complain, but sometimes I still do.
I am blessed!
Way better than I deserve!
Shhh. . . it's too early to tell.
I dunno. Is it Friday yet?
I don’t feel that great, but my hair looks awesome, right?
I have a pulse, so I must be okay.
Doing well, unless you have an airborne disease and infect me with some pathogens.
Oh, you know, every day is better than the next.
Better than some, not as good as others.
My psychiatrist told me not to discuss it with strangers.
I’m trying really hard to avoid ambiguous questions at the moment.
Wondering how you are.
How do you think I am?
I’ll leave that up to your imagination.
It's a secret.
Do you want the short or long version?
I would be lying if I said I’m fine.
I’m pretty sure I am not obligated to tell you.
Surviving, I guess.
Not as good as you.
In need of some peace and quiet.
Under renovation.
Remembering to stay patient.
On a scale from one to punching someone in the face?
Dancing to the rhythm of life.
Imagining myself having a fabulous vacation.
Horrible, now that I've met you.
You do not want to know.
That is a really wonderful question. Ummm...
In order to answer the question, I need to take you back about ten years. Do you have a moment?
Living a life of denial and suppressed rage.
Slowly but surely dying.
Fair to partly cloudy.
Groovy!
Not bad. Could be better. Could be payday.
I'm better on the inside than I look on the outside
Great, stellar, fantastic, but dead inside.
Okay, since my name wasn't in today's obituaries.
What's with all the questions? You a cop?
As opposed to what?
Sunshine all day long!
You go first so we can compare.
I'm not sure yet.
Living the dream, but half the time it's a nightmare.
Dangerously close to fabulous.
You're lookin' at it.
Real terrible, thanks for asking.
I am high-quality.
I'm sure you have that information on your screen.
How much will you pay me if I tell you?
Living the dream!
I'm taking over the world.
Dying.
Hunting dragons. You?
I promised myself I would kill the next person who asked me that question, but I like you so I will let you live.
Rolling with the punches.
Your attempt at social interaction is hereby acknowledged.
Incredibly good looking.
Everything is fine with you around.
I'd be better if you asked me out.
Great, but I’m totally biased.
Getting better with every passing minute.
Living a dream. Don't wake me up. You may join me. There's plenty of room.
The best I can be. Assuming you're at your best too.
I'm still sucking air.
I’m completely prepared for the end of the world.
They told me you would ask me that.
Better than nothing.
Well, I'm still alive.
Somewhere between blah and meh.
I’ll let you know when I figure it all out.
Do you want an honest answer or the answer you were expecting?
I'm vertical and breathing.
Different day, same existence.
Trying to get on with life, thanks. What about you?
Trying not to burst into tears. I get an “A” for effort, right?
Navigating the twists and turns of life. I hope yours is a straight road.
*What's something most people don's know about you?
I’m an introvert at heart
My wife’s nationality is Chinese
I speak Mandarin Chinese, but not because my wife does
I lived in Taiwan for two years (unrelated to my wife’s Chinese-ness, but very related to my ability to speak it)
We sent our daughter (on three different trips) to China, Australia, France, Germany, Spain and Switzerland when she was in high school as part of a program called, People to People Student Ambassadors
Gandhi has been a moral hero of mine since I was about 17 years old
I never dated in high school because I lacked confidence with girls until my college years
I was engaged to be married to another girl before I met my wife
Breaking the engagement with the other girl had nothing to do with meeting my wife (though it would have made a great story if it had!)
One of the most startling and rewarding parts of a high school teaching career has been all the former students who have kept in touch and still occasionally drop by to visit, even years later
One year a student hid in my closet for 45 minutes waiting for me to go home
I was the last guy anyone would have thought would start a blog
I still own a flip phone (proof of #12)
When my wife and I married, we had a grand total of about $27 to our name
As a kid, I was afraid of heights, so I forced myself to walk on top walls and climb trees and move onto precarious branches to challenge my fear
My guitar and piano are my creative and emotional outlets
But I can’t hit the right note with my voice if my life depended on it (I’m glad it doesn’t)
Now I start laughing every time I hear her stop, knowing what she’s doing
In high school, I wanted to become a rich and famous guitarist in a rich and famous rock band
I was never in a rock band
I live in Southern California, 20 minutes from the beach, a couple hours from the snow and almost always in the warmth
I get teary-eyed watching movies about families (especially parent-child relationships) and overcoming moral challenges
I’ve started writing 5 different books over the last 25 years or so
I’ve finished one … an eBook
I started a book on happiness when I was in my 20s
I’m 47 years young
I have a horrible memory
My college major was history with a U
My favorite place in the world is home
Every year my wife asks me what I want to do on my birthday (April 5th, in case you were wondering
Yep, I love pizza
I always capitalize the word Mom when referring to mine as a sign of the respect I pay motherhood and because my Mom qualifies for so much of it
I don’t have a favorite color
I started working with kids as a young adult for the express reason that I wanted to be a great dad and thought working with kids would help me reach that goal
I have big feet
I have ugly feet
When I was young, my feet smelled
They don’t smell anymore
I don’t care much that I have big ugly feet
I don’t want to talk about my feet anymore
I’m not particularly organized
I love staring at my wife
Our family reunions look a lot like a UN Summit Meeting
I’m 6’4”
I have hair on my toes
I know
Okay, I don’t want to talk about my feet anymore again
I had long hair in high school (yep, that’s me in the photo)
I was 24 when I married and 25 when we had our first baby
I have a weird sense of humor

*What do you like?
To spend time with my family
To play with my dog
To watch my favorite show in TV.
To hang out with my friends.
To study.
To go to beach with my family.
To hear my parents love story.
To read my favorite novel.
To learn a new language.
To play volleyball.
To dance.
To travel to unknown places.
To go in a train all alone by myself.
To watch the night sky.
To draw and paint.
To decorate my house.
To drive my bike.
To watch a horror movie in night.
To listen to music.
